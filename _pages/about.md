I am a computational neuroscientist with experience in statistics, machine learning, high-dimensional data visualization, and developing algorithms for neural decoding. I have pursued this work across academic settings, industry collaborations, and biotech consulting. Over the past 5 years, I have mentored several junior colleagues on their research projects, as well as teaching statistics and programming at both undergraduate and graduate levels.
